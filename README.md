Prospector is an Android app capable of capturing, storing, visualizing, and exporting data from LinkSquare handheld NIR spectrometers. Prospector provides fast, reliable capture of scans for phenotype prediction with a standardized user interface and data export format that has been adopted by BreedBase, a common breeding database (https://breedbase.org/). Prospector will allow breeders to rapidly apply NIRS for phenotyping, thereby streamlining the selection process and improving plant breeding productivity.

Development of Prospector has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (1543958). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
